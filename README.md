## Mobile Flashcards
----

This project is my submission for the Udacity React [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) "mobile flashcards" project.
It was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
The project's architecture and UI flow were heavily influenced by the project rubric.

I developed and tested this app using the android emulator.
